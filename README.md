# Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing for Amazon Reviews on Video Games

Steps taken in this project

   * Download the dataset of Amazon reviews.
   * Create my own dataset from the Amazon reviews.
   * Decided whether people like or dislike the video game they bought. Label each review with a sentiment score between -1 and 1.
   * Checked the performance of your sentiment analyzer by comparing the sentiment scores with the review ratings.
   * Evaluated the performance of your sentiment analyzer and find out if you managed to correctly label the reviews.
   * Trying out other methods of sentiment analysis. Explore how people evaluate the video game they purchased by classifying the reviews as positive, negative, and neutral.

## Techniques Utilized

In order to get a deeper understanding of peopleâ€™s opinions about video games, I needed to employ various NLP techniques. Here is a short list of the techniques I used:

   * Sampling from imbalanced datasets using the imbalanced-learn package
   * Enquiring about the sentiment value of the reviews with the dictionary-based sentiment analysis tools, which are part of NLTK, a natural language processing toolkit, used in Python.
   * Data evaluation with scikit-learn in Python.
   * Analyzing the reviews with a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, namely with the DistilBERT model. To build this model, you will need to run Pytorch, transformers, and the simpletransformers packages.
   * Evaluating your model and creating descriptive statistics in Python with scikit-learn library before reporting your results to your boss.
   * Visualizing your findings about preferable and non-preferable words related to video games using Altair.
